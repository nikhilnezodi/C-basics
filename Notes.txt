Declaration: Tells the compiler that I have a variable i of datatype integer. Don't allocate any memory. It has memory allocated by some other program.
Definition: I have a variable of type datatype. Also allocate some memory for the variable.

int i; (Declaration+Definition)

extern int i; (Declaration)


Pointers

        data_type * pointer_name;
for eg. int * p;
here p is a pointer of a memory location that stores integer value 
                    OR 
p stores address of a variable of type int

int a; ==> then &a represents address of a
p = &a; // so now p essentially points to address of a

p is also a variable that will be allocated a memory

* p = 10; this will modify the data stored at memory location of a

pointer can be helpful in accessing, reading/writing a given memory location.


suppose i want to point to 0x600
p = 0x600;
p+5 //now it will point to 0x605


//Structures
Struct is a user defined datatype
syntax of struct==>

struct student{
        int student_id;
        int class;
        int age;
        char * name;
};

struct student s;

To access student_id of this struct==> s.student_id
